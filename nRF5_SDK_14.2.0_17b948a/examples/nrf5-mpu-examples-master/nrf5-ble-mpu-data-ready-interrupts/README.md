# Example showing how to transmit MPU data via Nordic's UART over BLE service (NUS).
This example is based on Nordic's [UART/Serial Port Emulation over BLE example](http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/com.nordic.infocenter.sdk5.v11.0.0/ble_sdk_app_nus_eval.html?cp=4_0_1_4_2_2_18). It configures the MPU to trigger a data ready pin interrupt at a given interval. When the nRF5x receives the interrupt it reads the new MPU data. The data are then formatted into a string which is finally sent via BLE to e.g. a phone running the nRF Connect app.
