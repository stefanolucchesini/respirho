# nRF52 reading data from MPU using EasyDMA and GPIOTE

This example configures the nRF52 to read accelerometer data from MPU using EasyDMA while the CPU is sleeping. The example shows how to configure the timer, TWI, GPIOTE, and ppi register directly. A GPIOTE event is used to trigger a TWI transfer reading MPU samples. The GPIOTE event is triggered by a data ready interrupt generated by the MPU. A timer is used to count number of samples. When a certain number of samples have been collected the CPU awakes and the samples are printed to UART.
